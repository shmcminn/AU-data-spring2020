# COMM 618W: Data-Driven Journalism Spring 2020

**Credits**: 3

**Instructor**: Sean McMinn

**Contact**: seanpm92@gmail.com On weekdays, I will try to respond to all emails within 24 hours. If you do not hear from me within that time frame, feel free to send a follow-up email.

**Class time**: 9 a.m. - 5 p.m., Saturdays

**Office hours**: During class or by appointment

**Description**: Reporters find news every day by talking to people and unearthing their secrets. In this class, we're going to do the same — but with data. This is not a graphic design or programming class, but a course that will teach you how to use the huge number of datasets available to reporters in order to break news and help inform your audience through text and visuals. By the end of this course, you should be able to:

* Find datasets relevant to a story you're reporting
* Process and clean data
* Analyze and "interview" data to find a story within it
* Visualize and present a story based on data
* Speak the language of reporters and technologists who use data to tell stories
* Identify common problems with data and think critically about its use in news reporting

Much of this class (and its syllabus) is based on [Rachel Shorey's Spring 2018 Digital Frameworks](https://github.com/rshorey/digitalframeworks-spring18) course at Northwestern University.


### Expectations

* Come to class or let me know if you can't make it. I understand that situations occur that make it difficult to attend, and I'm willing to help you if you get in touch with me. Either way, you will be responsible for the material unless otherwise agreed upon.
* Because there are so few classes, you will only receive one excused absence. **A second absence for any reason will result in you losing half of your attendance points (10% pts. off your grade). A third absence for any reason will earn you a zero on attendance, and you will not be able to earn more than a B- in the class.** After one unexcused absence, an Early Warning notice will be filed to the student’s academic advisor. 
* Complete assignments either in class or as homework due before the next class. That means assignments are due at 9 a.m. on Saturdays, unless otherwise stated.
   * Late assignments will only be accepted if you contact me **before** the class in which it was originally due and we reach an agreement. 
* Submit assignments on Github (instructions in first lecture) as specified in the assignment.
* Consume the news every week, and come to class ready to share at least one story that uses data in a substantial way. I will randomly select two students to share a story at the beginning of class, so please have a link ready to go (and I will do the same). 
* Complete a final project, which will be a 1,000- to 1,300-word story with graphic proposals, based substantially on data. 
* I reserve the right to change this syllabus at any time, provided all changes are pushed to GitHub where you can track them in the "commits" section for this repository. If at any time you feel like a change I made isn't fair, you can tell me why and I'll reconsider it.
* As for software, please make sure you have the following: 
	* Microsoft Excel
	* Sublime text editor (free)
	* Tableau Public (free)
	* We might dabble in some other software as well, which we can download together. 
* I will use email as the primary means of communicating with the class, making your use a required element. Please make sure you check your AU email daily.
* All lectures/assignments/class materials will be available on Github.


### Grading

Your grade will be made up of three components:

* 20%: Class attendance and participation, including presenting data stories when I call on you to do so
* 50%: Assignments
* 30%: Final project

##### Assignment grading scale

* A: publishable with minimal edits
* B: publishable with significant edits
* C: would need reporter’s revision to be published
	* You cannot get more than a C on an assignment if there are factual errors.
* D: unpublishable, even with edits 
* F: did not complete work as assigned

**Note**: I will attempt to have all assignments graded within one week of you turning them in, and I will send you your assignment grades via email. Questions about assignments can be asked at any time. If you'd like to see your overall course grade, please talk to me during class and I'll show you a detailed breakdown.


### Collaboration

Students are encouraged to discuss assignments. For the most part, you will be working on different things, so talking about your work should not be a problem. Whiteboarding your way through a sticky problem with a friend or looking online for answers to technical questions are encouraged (data journalists do that all the time!). Your final work, however, must be entirely your own. A good rule of thumb is that no one else should take over your keyboard while completing an assignment. All American University policies regarding cheating apply to this class.

### Misc.

#### Emergency preparedness 

In the event of an emergency, American University will implement a plan for meeting the needs of all members of the university community. Should the university be required to close for a period of time, we are committed to ensuring that all aspects of our educational programs will be delivered to our students. These may include altering and extending the duration of the traditional term schedule to complete essential instruction in the traditional format and/or use of distance instructional methods. Specific strategies will vary from class to class, depending on the format of the course and the timing of the emergency. Faculty will communicate class- specific information to students via AU e-mail and Blackboard, while students must inform their faculty immediately of any absence. Students are responsible for checking their AU e-mail regularly and keeping themselves informed of emergencies. In the event of an emergency, students should refer to the AU Student Portal, the AU Web site (www.prepared.american.edu) and the AU information line at (202) 885-1100 for general university-wide information, as well as contact their faculty and/or respective dean’s office for course and school/ college-specific information.
