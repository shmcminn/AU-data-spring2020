MACE WINDU,PALPATINE,212,"Chancellor Palpatine, are you all right?",2,6,
PALPATINE,MACE WINDU,213,"Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.",1,18,
MACE WINDU,PALPATINE,214,"General Grievous will run and hide, as he always does. He's a coward.",2,13,
PALPATINE,MACE WINDU,215,"But with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.",1,31,

ANAKIN,PADME,233,I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.,1,38,

PALPATINE,GENERAL GRIEVOUS,245,"The end of the war is near, General.",1,8,
GENERAL GRIEVOUS,PALPATINE,246,But the loss of Count Dooku?,1,6,
PALPATINE,GENERAL GRIEVOUS,247,His death was a necessary loss. Soon I will have a new apprentice- one far younger and more powerful.,4,19,
PADME,ANAKIN,248,"Ani, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We can go to the lake country where no one will know... where we can be safe. I can go early and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.",1,47,
ANAKIN,PADME,249,You are so beautiful!,1,4,
PADME,ANAKIN,250,It's only because I'm so in love...,1,7,
ANAKIN,PADME,251,"No, no, it's because I'm so in love with you.",1,10,

ANAKIN,PADME,253,"Well, that's not exactly what I meant...",1,7,
PADME,ANAKIN,254,"But it's probably true! Anakin, help me! What's bothering you?",3,10,
ANAKIN,PADME,255,Nothing... I remember when I gave this to you.,2,9,
PADME,ANAKIN,256,How long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?,1,15,
ANAKIN,PADME,257,It was a dream.,1,4,
PADME,ANAKIN,258,Bad?,1,1,
ANAKIN,PADME,259,Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.,1,14,
PADME,ANAKIN,260,And?,1,1,
ANAKIN,PADME,261,And it was about you.,1,5,
PADME,ANAKIN,262,Tell me.,1,2,
ANAKIN,PADME,263,It was only a dream. You die in childbirth...,2,9,
PADME,ANAKIN,264,And the baby?,1,3,
ANAKIN,PADME,265,I don't know.,1,3,
PADME,ANAKIN,266,It was only a dream.,1,5,
ANAKIN,PADME,267,...I won't let this one become real.,1,7,
PADME,ANAKIN,268,"This baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled-.",1,33,
ANAKIN,PADME,269,"I know, I know.",1,4,
PADME,ANAKIN,270,Do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?,1,10,

ANAKIN,YODA,277,Yes.,1,1,
YODA,ANAKIN,278,"Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.",1,20,
ANAKIN,YODA,279,"I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.",1,9,
YODA,ANAKIN,280,"Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.",1,35,
ANAKIN,YODA,281,"What must I do, Master Yoda?",1,6,
YODA,ANAKIN,282,Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.,1,11,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,283,You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.,1,9,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,284,"I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.",1,10,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,285,"In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.",1,20,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,286,What's wrong then?,1,3,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,287,The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.,1,13,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,288,"Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.",1,24,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,289,Be careful of your friend Palpatine.,1,6,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,290,Be careful of what?,1,4,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,291,He has requested your presence.,1,5,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,292,What for?,1,2,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,293,He would not say.,1,4,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,294,"He didn't inform the Council? That's unusual, isn't it?",1,9,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,295,"All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy.",1,11,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,296,"I hope you trust me, Anakin.",1,6,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,297,Of course.,1,2,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,298,"I need your help, son.",1,5,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,299,What do you mean?,1,4,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,300,I'm depending on you.,1,4,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,301,For what? I don't understand.,1,5,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,302,"To be the eyes, ears and voice of the Republic. Anakin... I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.",2,23,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,303,"Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They'll never accept this.",1,18,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,304,I think they will... they need you more than you know.,1,11,
YODA,ANAKIN,305,"Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.",1,15,
ANAKIN,YODA,306,I understand.,1,2,
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,307,"You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.",1,15,
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,308,"What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair... How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?",1,24,
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,309,"Take a seat, young Skywalker.",1,5,
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,310,"Forgive me, Master.",1,3,
KI-ADI-MUNDI,GROUP,311,"We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, but have found no sign of General Grievous.",1,16,
YODA,KI-ADI-MUNDI,312,"Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.",1,13,
OBI-WAN,YODA,313,We do not have many ships to spare.,1,8,
KI-ADI-MUNDI,YODA,314,What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?,1,8,
MACE WINDU,YODA,315,"It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!",1,10,
OBI-WAN,YODA,316,"He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose.",1,11,
YODA,MACE WINDU,317,"Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.",1,10,
MACE WINDU,"YODA, KI-ADI-MUNDI, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN",318,It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.,1,24,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,319,"What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!",1,29,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,320,"Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age... It's never happened before. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.",1,45,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,321,"I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council...",1,13,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,322,But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.,1,15,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,323,That has nothing to do with this.,1,7,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,324,The only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.,1,15,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,325,And?,1,1,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,326,"Anakin, I am on your side. I didn't want to put you in this situation.",1,15,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,327,What situation?,1,2,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,328,The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.,1,20,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,329,They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!,1,10,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,330,"We are at war, Anakin.",1,5,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,331,Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?,1,13,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,332,This assignment is not to be on record.,1,8,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,333,"The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.",1,21,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,334,"That is why you must help us. Anakin, our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.",1,31,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,335,The Senate demanded that he stay longer.,1,7,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,336,"Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.",1,11,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,337,You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor... and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?,1,32,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,338,The Council is asking you.,1,5,
OBI-WAN,"MACE WINDU, YODA",339,Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.,1,10,
MACE WINDU,OBI-WAN,340,"It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.",1,18,
OBI-WAN,MACE WINDU,341,"With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?",1,24,
MACE WINDU,OBI-WAN,342,So the prophecy says.,1,4,
YODA,"OBI-WAN, MACE WINDU",343,A prophecy... that misread could have been.,1,7,
OBI-WAN,YODA,344,He will not let me down. He never has.,1,9,
YODA,OBI-WAN,345,I hope right you are.,1,5,
ANAKIN,PADME,346,"Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order... I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.",1,20,
PADME,ANAKIN,347,Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?,1,12,
ANAKIN,PADME,348,What do you mean?,1,4,
PADME,ANAKIN,349,"What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we've been fighting to destroy?",1,25,
ANAKIN,PADME,350,I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!,1,10,
PADME,ANAKIN,351,"This war represents a failure to listen... Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.",1,26,
ANAKIN,PADME,352,"Don't ask me to do that. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs.",1,19,
PADME,ANAKIN,353,What is it?,1,3,
ANAKIN,PADME,354,Nothing.,1,1,
PADME,ANAKIN,355,"Don't do this... don't shut me out. Let me help you. Hold me... like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago... when there was nothing but our love... No politics, no plotting... no war.",2,37,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,356,"You wanted to see me, Chancellor.",1,6,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,357,"Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He's hiding in the Utapau system.",1,25,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,358,"At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.",1,13,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,359,"I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice, by far. Sit down,",2,27,
PALPATINE,NA,360,Leave us.,1,2,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,361,"Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.",1,23,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,362,I'm not sure I understand.,1,5,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,363,You must sense what I have come to suspect... the Jedi Council want control of the Republic... they're planning to betray me.,1,22,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,364,I don't think...,1,3,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,365,"Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?",1,8,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,366,I know they don't trust you...,1,6,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,367,Or the Senate... or the Republic... or democracy for that matter.,1,11,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,368,I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.,1,11,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,369,"Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they? They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?",2,23,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,370,I don't uh... I don't know what to say.,1,9,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,371,"Remember back to your early teachings. ""All who gain power are afraid to lose it."" Even the Jedi.",1,18,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,372,The Jedi use their power for good.,1,7,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,373,"Good is a point of view, Anakin. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power.",2,24,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,374,"The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inwards, only about themselves.",1,15,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,375,And the Jedi don't?,1,4,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,376,The Jedi are selfless... they only care about others.,1,9,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,377,Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise?,1,11,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,378,No.,1,1,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,379,"I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.",1,63,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,380,He could actually save people from death?,1,7,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,381,The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.,1,17,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,382,What happened to him?,1,4,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,383,"He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.",2,48,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,384,Is it possible to learn this power?,1,7,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,385,Not from a Jedi.,1,4,
KI-ADI-MUNDI,ANAKIN,386,Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau?,1,7,
ANAKIN,"KI-ADI-MUNDI, OBI-WAN, MACE WINDU, YODA, CHEWIE",387,A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.,1,14,
YODA,"ANAKIN, KI-ADI-MUNDI, OBI-WAN, MACE WINDU, CHEWIE",388,"Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.",1,20,
ANAKIN,"KI-ADI-MUNDI, OBI-WAN, MACE WINDU, YODA, CHEWIE",389,The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.,1,9,
MACE WINDU,"KI-ADI-MUNDI, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, YODA, CHEWIE",390,"The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.",1,15,
YODA,"KI-ADI-MUNDI, OBI-WAN, MACE WINDU, ANAKIN, CHEWIE",391,"A Master is needed, with more experience.",1,7,
KI-ADI-MUNDI,"OBI-WAN, MACE WINDU, ANAKIN, YODA, CHEWIE",392,I concur. Master Kenobi should go.,1,6,
YODA,"KI-ADI-MUNDI, OBI-WAN, MACE WINDU, ANAKIN, CHEWIE",393,I agree.,1,2,
KI-ADI-MUNDI,"OBI-WAN, MACE WINDU, ANAKIN, YODA, CHEWIE",394,Aye,1,1,
MACE WINDU,"KI-ADI-MUNDI, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, YODA, CHEWIE",395,Aye Very well. Council is adjourned.,2,6,
CHEWIE,NA,396,,1,8,
CLONE COMMANDER GREE,YODA,397,The droids have started up their main power generators.,1,9,
YODA,NA,398,"Then now the time is, Commander.",1,6,
CHEWIE,NA,399,GROWL,1,1,
CLONE COMMANDER GREE,NA,400,"Yes, sir.",1,2,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,401,"You're going to need me on this one, Master.",1,9,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,402,"Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.",1,15,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,403,Master! I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training... I have been arrogant and I apologize... I've just been so frustrated with the Council.,2,28,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,404,"You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.",1,61,
ANAKIN,OBI-WAN,405,Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you.,1,7,
OBI-WAN,ANAKIN,406,"Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.",1,9,
CLONE COMMANDER CODY,OBI-WAN,407,"Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here... on the far side.",1,16,
OBI-WAN,CLONE COMMANDER CODY,408,I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.,1,13,
CLONE COMMANDER CODY,OBI-WAN,409,"Come on, when have I ever let you down?",1,9,
OBI-WAN,CLONE COMMANDER CODY,410,"Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids unil you arrive",1,16,
OBI-WAN,NA,411,Save your energy.,1,3,
PADME,NA,412,I can't!,1,2,
OBI-WAN,NA,413,"Don't give up, Padme.",1,4,
ANAKIN,PADME,414,"Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?",1,5,
PADME,ANAKIN,415,He came by this morning.,1,5,
ANAKIN,PADME,416,What did he want?,1,4,
PADME,ANAKIN,417,He's worried about you. He says you're been under a lot of stress.,2,13,
ANAKIN,PADME,418,I feel lost.,1,3,
PADME,ANAKIN,419,Lost? What do you mean?,1,5,
ANAKIN,PADME,420,Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.,1,7,
PADME,ANAKIN,421,They trust you with their lives.,1,6,
ANAKIN,PADME,422,"Something's happening... I'm not the Jedi I should be. I want more, and I know I shouldn't.",1,17,
PADME,ANAKIN,423,You expect too much of yourself.,1,6,
ANAKIN,PADME,424,I have found a way to save you.,1,8,
PADME,ANAKIN,425,Save me?,1,2,
ANAKIN,PADME,426,From my nightmares.,1,3,
PADME,ANAKIN,427,Is that what's bothering you?,1,5,
ANAKIN,PADME,428,"I won't lose you, Padme.",1,5,
PADME,ANAKIN,429,"I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.",1,11,
ANAKIN,PADME,430,"No, I promise you!",1,4,
TION MEDON,OBI-WAN,431,"Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?",1,10,
OBI-WAN,TION MEDON,432,"Unfortunately, the war.",1,3,
TION MEDON,OBI-WAN,433,There's no war here. Unless you've brought it with you.,1,10,
OBI-WAN,TION MEDON,434,"With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.",1,25,
TION MEDON,OBI-WAN,435,He is here. We are being held hostage. They are watching us.,1,12,
OBI-WAN,TION MEDON,436,I understand.,1,2,
TION MEDON,OBI-WAN,437,"Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.",1,6,
OBI-WAN,TION MEDON,438,"Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time.",1,14,
OBI-WAN,NA,439,Take the Fighter back to the ship. I'm staying here. Tell Cody I've made contact.,1,15,
ALIEN 2,TION MEDON,440,Is he bringing additional warriors?,1,5,
TION MEDON,ALIEN 2,441,He didn't say..,1,3,
GENERAL GRIEVOUS,NUTE,442,It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet. You will be safe there.,1,35,
NUTE,GENERAL GRIEVOUS,443,"Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.",1,22,
GENERAL GRIEVOUS,NUTE,444,"Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip... Your ship is waiting.",1,15,
OBI-WAN,GENERAL GRIEVOUS,445,"Hello, there!",1,2,
GENERAL GRIEVOUS,OBI-WAN,446,"General Kenobi, you are a bold one.",1,7,
GENERAL GRIEVOUS,NA,447,Kill him! Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.,2,12,
OBI-WAN,GENERAL GRIEVOUS,448,Your move.,1,2,
GENERAL GRIEVOUS,OBI-WAN,449,"You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku. Attack, Kenobi. Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.",2,24,
OBI-WAN,GENERAL GRIEVOUS,450,"Oh, I don't think so.",1,5,
CLONE COMMANDER CODY,MACE WINDU,451,"Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we have begun our attack.",2,19,
MACE WINDU,CLONE COMMANDER CODY,452,"Thank, you Commander.",1,3,
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,453,"Anakin, deliver this report to the chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions.",1,17,
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,454,"Yes, Master.",1,2,
MACE WINDU,"KI-ADI-MUNDI, YODA",455,I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.,1,17,
KI-ADI-MUNDI,"MACE WINDU, YODA",456,"If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from office.",1,21,
MACE WINDU,"KI-ADI-MUNDI, YODA",457,The jedi council would have to take control of the senate in order to secure a peaceful transition.,1,18,
YODA,"MACE WINDU, KI-ADI-MUNDI",458,To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmm... great care we must take.,1,17,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,459,"Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.",1,15,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,460,We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.,1,12,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,461,I should be there with him.,1,6,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,462,It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?,1,28,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,463,I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.,1,33,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,464,"They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. You must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.",1,44,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,465,How do you know the ways of the Force?,1,9,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,466,My mentor taught me everything about the Force... even the nature of the dark side.,1,15,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,467,You know the dark side?,1,5,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,468,"Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.",2,82,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,469,What did you say?,1,4,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,470,"Use my knowledge, I beg you...",1,6,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,471,You're the Sith Lord!,1,4,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,472,"I know what has been troubling you... Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi... a life of significance, of conscience. Are you going to kill me?",2,50,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,473,I would certainly like to.,1,5,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,474,"I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.",1,16,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,475,I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.,1,11,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,476,"Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you?",1,13,
ANAKIN,PALPATINE,477,I will quickly discover the truth of all this.,1,9,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,478,"You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. The power to save Padme.",1,17,
OBI-WAN,OBI-WAN,479,So uncivilized...,1,2,
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,480,"Master Windu, I must talk to you.",1,7,
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,481,"Skywalker, we just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We're on our way to make sure the chancellor returns emergency power back to the senate.",3,27,
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,482,He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.,1,20,
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,483,A Sith Lord?,1,3,
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,484,Yes. The one we have been looking for.,1,8,
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,485,How do you know this?,1,5,
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,486,He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.,1,16,
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,487,Are you sure?,1,3,
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,488,Absolutely.,1,1,
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,489,Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.,1,18,
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,490,"Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.",1,18,
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,491,"For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.",1,28,
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,492,"I must go, Master.",1,4,
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,493,"No. If what you've told me is true, you will have gained my trust. But for now, remain here. Wait in the council's chambers until we've returned.",1,27,
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,494,"Yes, Master.",1,2,
PALPATINE,HEAD,495,"You do know, don't you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.",1,18,
PALPATINE,MACE WINDU,496,"Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.",1,19,
MACE WINDU,PALPATINE,497,"In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.",1,15,
PALPATINE,MACE WINDU,498,"Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?",1,6,
MACE WINDU,PALPATINE,499,The Senate will decide your fate.,1,6,
PALPATINE,MACE WINDU,500,I am the Senate!,1,4,
MACE WINDU,PALPATINE,501,Not yet!,1,2,
PALPATINE,MACE WINDU,502,"It's treason, then.",1,3,
MACE WINDU,PALPATINE,503,"You are under arrest, My Lord.",1,6,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,504,Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.,1,17,
MACE WINDU,PALPATINE,505,The oppression of the Sith will never return. You have lost.,1,11,
PALPATINE,MACE WINDU,506,No! No! No! You will die!,1,6,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,507,He's a traitor.,1,3,
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,508,He is a traitor!,1,4,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,509,I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose.,1,13,
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,510,"Don't listen to him, Anakin!",1,5,
PALPATINE,ANAKIN,511,Don't let him kill me. I can't hold it any longer. I can't. I'm weak. I'm too weak. Anakin! Help me. Help me! I can't hold on any longer.,4,29,
MACE WINDU,"PALPATINE, ANAKIN",512,I am going to end this once and for all.,1,10,
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,513,You can't. He must stand trial.,1,6,
MACE WINDU,ANAKIN,514,He has control of the senate and the courts. He's too dangerous to be left alive.,1,16,
PALPATINE,MACE WINDU,515,But I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.,1,8,
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,516,It is not the Jedi way... He must live...,2,9,
PALPATINE,MACE WINDU,517,"Please don't, please don't...",1,4,
ANAKIN,MACE WINDU,518,I need him...,1,3,
