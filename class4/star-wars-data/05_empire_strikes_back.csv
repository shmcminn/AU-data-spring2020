LUKE,HAN,3,"Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any life readings.",2,12,
HAN,LUKE,4,"There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. Sensors are placed, I'm going back.",4,19,
LUKE,HAN,5,Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take long.,4,24,

LEIA,HAN,29,"Han, we need you!",1,4,
HAN,LEIA,30,We need?,1,2,
LEIA,HAN,31,Yes.,1,1,
HAN,LEIA,32,"Well, what about you need?",1,5,
LEIA,HAN,33,I need? I don't know what you're talking about.,2,9,
HAN,LEIA,34,You probably don't.,1,3,
LEIA,HAN,35,And what precisely am I supposed to know?,2,8,
HAN,LEIA,36,Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.,3,15,
LEIA,HAN,37,Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...,2,11,

LEIA,HAN,39,You're imagining things.,1,3,
HAN,LEIA,40,Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss?,3,20,
LEIA,HAN,41,I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.,1,7,
HAN,LEIA,42,I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!,2,10,

THREEPIO,R2D2,45,ask you to turn on the thermal,1,7,
R2D2,THREEPIO,46,,1,1,
THREEPIO,R2D2,47,heater. I merely commented that it,1,6,
R2D2,THREEPIO,48,,1,1,
THREEPIO,R2D2,49,was freezing in the princess' chamber.,2,6,
R2D2,THREEPIO,50,,1,6,
THREEPIO,R2D2,51,But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know.,3,20,

THREEPIO,HAN,60,"Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator.",3,14,
HAN,THREEPIO,61,I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.,2,11,
THREEPIO,HAN,62,"Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is.",4,19,
HAN,THREEPIO,63,I don't know where he is.,1,6,
THREEPIO,HAN,64,Nobody knows where he is.,1,5,

DECK OFFICER,HAN,69,"Yes, sir?",1,2,
HAN,DECK OFFICER,70,Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?,2,7,
DECK OFFICER,HAN,71,I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the south entrance.,2,13,
HAN,DECK OFFICER,72,It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out there.,2,13,
DECK OFFICER,HAN,73,"Yes, sir.",1,2,
THREEPIO,HAN,74,"Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?",2,9,
HAN,THREEPIO,75,Why not?,1,2,
THREEPIO,R2D2,76,"Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, let's find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.",4,19,
R2D2,THREEPIO,77,,1,4,
DECK OFFICER,HAN,78,"Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in.",3,17,
HAN,DECK OFFICER,79,Not likely. Are the speeders ready?,1,6,
DECK OFFICER,HAN,80,Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the cold.,2,11,
HAN,DECK OFFICER,81,We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.,2,7,
DECK OFFICER,HAN,82,"Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly.",2,6,

THREEPIO,R2D2,91,There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up.,2,13,
R2D2,THREEPIO,92,,1,8,
THREEPIO,R2D2,93,Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again.,2,12,

HAN,LEIA,146,"Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer.",3,16,
LEIA,HAN,147,I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy field.,4,25,
HAN,LEIA,148,That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.,3,21,

HAN,LEIA,173,Afraid there's not much left.,1,5,
LEIA,HAN,174,What was it?,1,3,
HAN,LEIA,175,Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct.,3,16,
LEIA,HAN,176,An Imperial probe droid.,1,4,
HAN,"LEIA, RIEEKAN",177,It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.,2,9,

PIETT,OZZEL,179,Admiral.,1,1,
OZZEL,PIETT,180,"Yes, Captain",1,2,
PIETT,OZZEL,181,"I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've had.",4,27,
OZZEL,PIETT,182,"We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy. I want proof, not leads!",3,14,
PIETT,OZZEL,183,The visuals indicate life readings.,1,5,
OZZEL,PIETT,184,It could mean anything. If we followed up every lead...,2,10,
PIETT,OZZEL,185,"But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms.",2,13,
VADER,PIETT,186,You found something?,1,3,
PIETT,VADER,187,"Yes, my lord.",1,3,
VADER,"PIETT, OZZEL",188,That's it. The Rebels are there.,1,6,
OZZEL,VADER,189,"My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be smugglers, it could be...",3,15,

MEDICAL DROID,LUKE,198,"Sir, it will take quite a while to evacuate the T-forty-sevens.",2,11,

A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was.

HAN,LEIA,642,This is no cave.,1,4,
LEIA,HAN,643,What?,1,1,
YODA,LUKE,644,"Yes, run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger... fear... aggression. The dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.",11,60,
LUKE,YODA,645,Vader. Is the dark side stronger?,1,6,
YODA,LUKE,646,"No, no. No. Quicker, easier, more seductive.",2,7,
LUKE,YODA,647,But how am I to know the good side from the bad?,2,12,
YODA,LUKE,648,"You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.",4,22,

LUKE,YODA,708,I can't. It's too big.,1,5,
YODA,LUKE,709,"Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? And well you should not. For my ally is the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow.

CHEWIE,HAN,727,,1,3,
THREEPIO,HAN,728,I really don't see how that is going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...,5,25,
HAN,LEIA,729,Thank you.,1,2,
LEIA,HAN,730,What did you have in mind for your next move?,2,10,
HAN,LEIA,731,"Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.",5,21,
LEIA,HAN,732,With the rest of the garbage. Then what?,2,8,
HAN,LEIA,733,Then we got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any ideas?,3,14,
LEIA,HAN,734,No. Where are we?,1,4,
HAN,LEIA,735,The Anoat system.,1,3,
LEIA,HAN,736,Anoat system. There's not much there.,2,6,

LEIA,HAN,740,Thanks.,1,1,
HAN,LEIA,741,"Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.",2,11,
LEIA,HAN,742,A mining colony?,1,3,
HAN,LEIA,743,"Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go back a long way, Lando and me.",3,20,

HAN,LANDO,812,How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?,2,10,
LANDO,HAN,813,"Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had labor difficulties... What's so funny?",6,30,
HAN,LANDO,814,"You. Listen to you - you sound like a businessman, a responsible leader. Who'd have thought that, huh?",3,18,
LANDO,HAN,815,"You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things.",2,10,

LANDO,"LEIA, HAN, CHEWIE",884,"operation, we don't fall into the...jurisdiction of the Empire.",3,11,
LEIA,LANDO,885,So you're part of the mining guild then?,2,8,
LANDO,LEIA,886,"No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be noticed... which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.",6,28,
HAN,LANDO,887,Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?,3,17,
LANDO,"HAN, LEIA, CHEWIE",888,That's always been a danger that looms like a shadow over everything we've built here. But things have developed that will ensure security.,4,23,
