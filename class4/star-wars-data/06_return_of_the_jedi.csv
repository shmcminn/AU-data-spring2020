LUKE,YODA,305,Then I am a Jedi.,1,5,
YODA,LUKE,306,"Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains -- Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.",1,25,
LUKE,YODA,307,Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?,1,7,
YODA,LUKE,308,Mmm... rest I need. Yes. Rest.,1,6,
LUKE,YODA,309,"Yoda, I must know.",1,4,
YODA,LUKE,310,"Your father he is. Told you, did he?",2,8,
LUKE,YODA,311,Yes.,1,1,
YODA,LUKE,312,Unexpected this is. And unfortunate.,1,5,
LUKE,YODA,313,Unfortunate that I know the truth?,1,6,
YODA,LUKE,314,"No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him, that incomplete was your training, that not ready for the burden were you.",1,21,
LUKE,YODA,315,I'm sorry.,1,2,
YODA,LUKE,316,"Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression, the dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Luke... Luke... Do not... Do not underestimate the powers of the emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned. Luke... There is... another... Sky...Sky...walker.",2,82,

OBI-WAN,LUKE,321,Yoda will always be with you.,1,6,force
LUKE,OBI-WAN,322,Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.,2,15,force
OBI-WAN,LUKE,323,"You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.",1,47,force
LUKE,OBI-WAN,324,A certain point of view?,1,5,force
OBI-WAN,LUKE,325,"Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. Anakin was a good friend. When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong.",2,75,force
LUKE,OBI-WAN,326,There is still good in him.,1,6,force
OBI-WAN,LUKE,327,He's more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.,1,9,force
LUKE,OBI-WAN,328,"I can't do it, Ben.",1,5,force
OBI-WAN,LUKE,329,You cannot escape your destiny. You must face Darth Vader again!,1,11,force
LUKE,OBI-WAN,330,I can't kill my own father.,1,6,force
OBI-WAN,LUKE,331,Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.,1,11,force
LUKE,OBI-WAN,332,Yoda spoke of another.,1,4,force
OBI-WAN,LUKE,333,The other he spoke of is your twin sister.,1,9,force
LUKE,OBI-WAN,334,But I have no sister.,1,5,force
OBI-WAN,LUKE,335,"Hmm. To protect you both from the emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.",1,48,force
LUKE,OBI-WAN,336,Leia! Leia's my sister.,1,4,force
OBI-WAN,LUKE,337,"Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the emperor.",1,24,force

MON MOTHMA,GROUP,343,"The emperor's made a critical error and the time for our attack has come. The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that the emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information.",4,99,

ADMIRAL ACKBAR,GROUP,345,"You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack.",4,98,

LUKE,LEIA,597,Tell me.,1,2,
LEIA,LUKE,598,"She was very beautiful. Kind, but sad. Why are you asking me this?",2,13,
LUKE,LEIA,599,I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.,1,11,
LEIA,LUKE,600,"Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?",1,6,
LUKE,LEIA,601,"Vader is here. Now, on this moon.",1,7,
LEIA,LUKE,602,How do you know?,1,4,
LUKE,LEIA,603,"I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go. As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here. I have to face him.",4,38,
LEIA,LUKE,604,Why?,1,1,
LUKE,LEIA,605,He's my father.,1,3,
LEIA,LUKE,606,Your father?,1,2,
LUKE,LEIA,607,"There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.",1,27,
LEIA,LUKE,608,"Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.",1,16,
LUKE,LEIA,609,"You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time, you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it. I have it. And... my sister has it. Yes. It's you, Leia.",2,41,
LEIA,LUKE,610,I know. Somehow... I've always known.,1,6,
LUKE,LEIA,611,Then you know why I have to face him.,1,9,
LEIA,LUKE,612,"No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.",1,23,
LUKE,LEIA,613,"No, you don't. You've always been strong.",1,7,
LEIA,LUKE,614,"But, why must you confront him?",1,6,
LUKE,LEIA,615,Because... there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.,1,34,
HAN,LEIA,616,"Hey, what's goin' on?",1,4,
LEIA,HAN,617,Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.,1,12,
HAN,LEIA,618,"Nothing? Come on, tell me. What's goin' on?",1,8,
LEIA,HAN,619,I...I can't tell you.,1,4,
HAN,LEIA,620,Could you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?,1,10,
LEIA,HAN,621,I-,1,1,
HAN,LEIA,622,Ah. I'm sorry.,2,3,
LEIA,HAN,623,Hold me.,1,2,
COMMANDER,VADER,624,"This is a rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. He was armed only with this.",2,38,

VADER,LUKE,629,"So, you have accepted the truth.",1,6,
LUKE,VADER,630,"I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.",1,12,
VADER,LUKE,631,That name no longer has any meaning for me.,1,9,
LUKE,VADER,632,It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That was why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your emperor now.,1,43,
VADER,LUKE,633,"I see you have constructed a new lightsaber. Your skills are complete. Indeed you are powerful, as the emperor has foreseen.",2,21,
LUKE,VADER,634,Come with me.,1,3,
VADER,LUKE,635,Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.,2,20,
LUKE,VADER,636,"I will not turn, and you'll be forced to kill me.",1,11,
VADER,LUKE,637,If that is your destiny.,1,5,
LUKE,VADER,638,"Search your feelings, Father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.",1,19,
VADER,LUKE,639,"It is too late for me, son. The emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.",1,23,
