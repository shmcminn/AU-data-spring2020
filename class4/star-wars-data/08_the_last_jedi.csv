LUKE,REY,303,Let's get started.,1,3,
REY,LUKE,304,Who were those things?,1,4,
LUKE,REY,305,Caretakers. Island natives. They've kept up the Jedi structures since they were built.,1,13,

REY,LUKE,310,It's a power that Jedi have that lets them control people and make things float.,1,15,
LUKE,REY,311,"Impressive. Every word in that sentence was wrong. Lesson one, sit here, legs crossed. The Force is not a power you have. It's not about lifting rocks. It's the energy between all things, a tension, a balance that binds the universe together.",1,42,

LUKE,REY,313,"Close your eyes. Breathe. Now, reach out.",1,7,

LUKE,REY,325,And inside you?,1,3,
REY,LUKE,326,"Inside me, that same Force.",1,5,
LUKE,REY,327,"And this is the lesson. That Force does not belong to the Jedi. To say that if the Jedi die, the light dies, is vanity. Can you feel that?",1,29,
REY,LUKE,328,There's something else beneath the island. A place. A dark place.,1,11,
LUKE,REY,329,"Balance. Powerful light, powerful darkness.",1,5,

LUKE,REY,333,It offered you something you needed. And you didn't even try to stop yourself.,1,14,
